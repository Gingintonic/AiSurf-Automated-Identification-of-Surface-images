[SIFT]
;sift parameters are well explained in:
; https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.9/d5/d3c/classcv_1_1xfeatures2d_1_1sift.html
contrast_threshold = 0.092
sigma = 10
noctavelayers = 21

[Keypoint filtering]
;these are thresholds to filter out keypoints that could get in the way of the method
;both are in units of the median keypoint size
;all keypoints that are bigger than median*size_threshold are deleted
;all keypoints that are closer than median*edge_threshold to one border of the image are deleted
size_threshold = 1.4
edge_threshold = 1

[Keypoint Clustering]
;clusterings with n clusters between lower and upper bound are evaluated wrt their silhouette score
;the one with the maximal silhouette score is chosen for further processing
nclusters_lower_bound = 2
nclusters_upper_bound = 15

[Nearest Neighbours]
;number_of_nn should be self explanatory (nn stands for nearest neighbours
;usually to get a good clustering of the nn distribution lower bound should be set to k1
;and upper bound to k1*4
;clustersize_threshold is used to reduce impact of erroneous nn-vectors on the selection of the lattice vectors
;in the final distribution only nn-clusters with members n>=clustersize_threshold*n_max are considered
;usually clustersize_threshold is set to 0.3
number_of_nn = 6
nclusters_lower_bound = 6
nclusters_upper_bound = 24
clustersize_threshold = 0.3

[Sublattice lookup]
;clustering parameters for the sublattice distribution
nclusters_lower_bound = 2
nclusters_upper_bound = 20

[Deviation plot]
;for the final deviation plot nearest neighbours are calculated wrt to all keypoints
;not just for the (presumably regular) keypoint cluster with most number of keypoints
;therefore it is usually better to chose k2 bigger than k1
;all vectors that are within the relative_r-tolerance of the lattice vectors are drawn
;the arrow_width can also be specified here (see matplotlib.quiver() - width parameter)
;it is in units of the plot width (usual value 0.005)
number_of_nn = 20
relative_r-tolerance = 3.5
arrow_width = 0.003
